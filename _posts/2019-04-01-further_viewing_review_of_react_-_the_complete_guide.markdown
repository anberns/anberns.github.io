For this post I want to offer an unsolicitated review and recommendation for a Udemy class that I've found to be invaluable in learning React and Redux. The class is called *React - The Complete Guide* and can be found on Udemy's site for as low as $11 when on sale. The instructor's name is Maximilian Schwarzmuller and he is adept at outlining and explaining the intricacies of both React and Redux.

I came across this class before starting Flatiron because I had heard that React was a hot frontend framework and wanted to investigate. The course's structure is, in my opinion, ideal in that major concepts are introduced in videos that aren't linked to a major project first, then implemented in an overarching project approach that many books and courses follow. I really appreciate having the choice of learning the material without having to follow along with the core project. It's easy to jump into any area of React or Redux to pick up a new skill or refresh your memory without getting bogged down in project details. The project itself is also helpful in that it provides a real world-ish app to tie everything together.

The course is composed of modules that touch on all of the major topics for React and Redux from components, state, props, and lifecycle methods to createStore, action creators, routing and async actions using thunk. There are also modules on authentication with React, deploying to the web and the newer topic of using Hooks in functional components to access state. Each module is composed of several 2 to 8 minute videos of live-coding that do a nice job of breaking up each lesson into a digestable slice of knowledge. 

The instructor does an excellent job of walking through new concepts and showing how they build on what's come before. He's chipper and delivers his lessons with well-chosen and concise language. I had no difficulty understanding his lectures despite his having a non-trivial German accent and frequently substituting 'w' sounds for v's (think wisit for visit). It's actually pretty endearing.

Where he really shines, in my opinion, is in the sections on Redux. Before jumping into any code, he walks you through the relationships between store, dispatches, reducers and mapped props using a helpful graphic, shown below.

Before diving into the complicated process of integrating Redux with React, he builds a Redux store and it's related methods from the ground up, piece by piece, while narrating the entire endeavor.  I've added a screenshot below of a portion of this lecture that shows the humble beginnings of what will later become a complex library integration. Seeing all of the facets of the library written out and connected in the same file really helped me wrap my head around the relationships between Redux functionalities.

As a former teacher, I appreciate the scaffolded approach and visual support of this course. It's clear to me that Maximilian is a skilled developer and instructor. If you're looking to supplement your knowledge of React and Redux, this course should be your first stop. Again, this blog post originates from a desire to share a resource that has been extremely helpful to me in trying to piece together all of the moving parts inherent in the topic. The course can be found at the link below.
